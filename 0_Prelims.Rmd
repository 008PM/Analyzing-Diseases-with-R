## 1. Define column names and read data

-   Defines 11 column names (e.g., `"epi_week"`, `"country"`, `"disease"`) to organize the dataset.
-   Reads `Tycho_L2.csv` into a data frame using custom column names, assuming no header row.

``` r
# Define column names
column_names <- c(
  "epi_week", "country", "state", "loc", "loc_type", 
  "disease", "event", "number", "from_date", "to_date", "url"
)

# Read the CSV file
df_clean <- read.csv("Tycho_L2.csv", col.names = column_names, header = FALSE)
```

## 2. Filter and transform data

-   Filters data for 10 major cities (e.g., New York City, Chicago).

-   Converts the number column to numeric, handling invalid entries as NA.

-   Groups data by city and disease, summing death counts.

-   Identifies the disease with the highest death count per city.

-   Renames columns to ‚ÄúCity‚Äù, ‚ÄúTop Disease‚Äù, ‚ÄúDeath Count‚Äù for clarit

``` r
# Load dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Define target cities
target_cities <- c(
  "NEW YORK CITY", "LOS ANGELES", "CHICAGO", "HOUSTON", "PHOENIX", 
  "PHILADELPHIA", "SAN ANTONIO", "SAN DIEGO", "DALLAS", "JACKSONVILLE"
)

# Ensure 'number' column is numeric
df_clean$number <- as.numeric(df_clean$number)

# Filter for target cities (case-insensitive)
filtered_df <- df_clean[toupper(df_clean$loc) %in% target_cities, ]

# Group by city and disease, summing death counts
grouped <- filtered_df %>%
  group_by(loc, disease) %>%
  summarise(number = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Get the disease with the highest death count per city
result_df <- grouped %>%
  group_by(loc) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = number, n = 1) %>%
  ungroup()

# Rename columns for clarity
colnames(result_df) <- c("City", "Top Disease", "Death Count")
```

``` r
# Save the result_df data frame to a new CSV file
write.csv(result_df, "top_disease_by_city.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Confirm the file has been saved
cat("CSV file 'top_disease_by_city.csv' has been created.\n")
```

-   Exports the result_df data frame to top_disease_by_city.csv without row indices.
-   Confirms the file creation with a printed message.

``` r
# Save result_df to a CSV file
write.csv(result_df, "top_disease_by_city.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Confirm the file has been saved
cat("CSV file 'top_disease_by_city.csv' has been created.\n")
```

## 3.Aggregating and Mapping State-Level Death Counts from Tycho_L2.csv

-   Descriptive: It summarizes the script‚Äôs key actions‚Äîaggregating death counts by state and mapping abbreviations to full names.
-   Specific: Mentions the input file (Tycho_L2.csv) and the focus on state-level data.
-   Professional: Clear and concise for documentation or sharing in a project context.
-   Engaging: Straightforward yet informative, making it easy to explain to Lisa with a playful spin if needed (e.g., ‚ÄúLisa, check out this cool - state data crunch! üòé‚Äù)

``` r
# Load dplyr package (install if needed: install.packages("dplyr"))
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
df <- read.csv("Tycho_L2.csv")
colnames(df) <- trimws(colnames(df))

# Filter for DEATHS and ensure valid death counts
df_deaths <- df %>%
  filter(event == "DEATHS") %>%
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>%
  filter(number > 0 & !is.na(number))

# Group by state and sum deaths
state_death_counts <- df_deaths %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Map state abbreviations to full names
state_name_map <- c(
  AL = "Alabama", AK = "Alaska", AZ = "Arizona", AR = "Arkansas", CA = "California",
  CO = "Colorado", CT = "Connecticut", DE = "Delaware", FL = "Florida", GA = "Georgia",
  HI = "Hawaii", ID = "Idaho", IL = "Illinois", IN = "Indiana", IA = "Iowa", KS = "Kansas",
  KY = "Kentucky", LA = "Louisiana", ME = "Maine", MD = "Maryland", MA = "Massachusetts",
  MI = "Michigan", MN = "Minnesota", MS = "Mississippi", MO = "Missouri", MT = "Montana",
  NE = "Nebraska", NV = "Nevada", NH = "New Hampshire", NJ = "New Jersey", NM = "New Mexico",
  NY = "New York", NC = "North Carolina", ND = "North Dakota", OH = "Ohio", OK = "Oklahoma",
  OR = "Oregon", PA = "Pennsylvania", RI = "Rhode Island", SC = "South Carolina", SD = "South Dakota",
  TN = "Tennessee", TX = "Texas", UT = "Utah", VT = "Vermont", VA = "Virginia",
  WA = "Washington", WV = "West Virginia", WI = "Wisconsin", WY = "Wyoming", DC = "District of Columbia"
)

state_death_counts$state_name <- state_name_map[state_death_counts$state]

# Reorder columns
state_death_counts <- state_death_counts %>%
  select(state_abbr = state, state_name, total_deaths)

# Save to CSV
write.csv(state_death_counts, "state_death_totals.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Confirm save
cat("Saved file with state abbreviations, full names, and death totals to 'state_death_totals.csv'\n")
```

## 4.Summing and Sorting Disease Death Totals

-   Load Data: Use read.csv to load L2_10city.csv.
-   Filter and Group: Filter for event == "DEATHS", group by disease, and sum the number column using dplyr.
-   Sort and Rename: Sort by total deaths in descending order and rename columns to ‚ÄúDisease‚Äù and ‚ÄúTotal_Deaths‚Äù.
-   Save to CSV: Use write.csv to save the result to disease_totals.csv without row names.
-   Print Results: Display the results and a confirmation message.
-   Error Handling: Use tryCatch to handle file-not-found and other errors.
-   Bullet Points: Summarize the script‚Äôs actions under a clear title for documentation

``` r
# Load dplyr package (install if needed: install.packages("dplyr"))
library(dplyr)

# Define file paths
input_file <- "L2_10city.csv"
output_file <- "disease_totals.csv"

# Read and process data with error handling
tryCatch({
  # Read the data
  df <- read.csv(input_file)
  
  # Filter for DEATHS events
  deaths_df <- df %>% filter(event == "DEATHS")
  
  # Group by disease and sum death counts
  disease_totals <- deaths_df %>%
    group_by(disease) %>%
    summarise(Total_Deaths = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    rename(Disease = disease) %>%
    arrange(desc(Total_Deaths))
  
  # Save to CSV
  write.csv(disease_totals, output_file, row.names = FALSE)
  
  # Print confirmation and results
  cat("Successfully created aggregated file:", output_file, "\n\n")
  cat("Disease Totals:\n")
  print(disease_totals, row.names = FALSE)
  
}, error = function(e) {
  if (grepl("cannot open file", e$message)) {
    cat("Error: File '", input_file, "' not found. Please check the file path.\n", sep = "")
  } else {
    cat("An error occurred: ", e$message, "\n", sep = "")
  }
})
```

## 5.Creating and Saving Disease Communicable Status Data

-   Builds a data frame listing diseases, their total death counts, and communicable status (C/NC).
-   Exports the data frame to diseases_with_communicable_status.csv.
-   Prints a success message and shows the disease names with their communicable status.

``` r
# Create data frame with disease classification data
df <- data.frame(
  Disease = c("Tuberculosis", "Pneumonia", "Pneumonia And Influenza", 
              "Diphtheria", "Typhoid Fever", "Influenza", "Scarlet Fever", 
              "Whooping Cough", "Meningitis", "Smallpox", "Brucellosis",
              "Pellagra", "Chickenpox", "Typhus Fever", "Varioloid",
              "Cholera", "Yellow Fever", "Dengue", "Leprosy"),
  Total_Deaths = c(610350, 429167, 254963, 97441, 43672, 38054, 34445,
                   16624, 4048, 2566, 1447, 754, 579, 244, 9, 6, 4, 2, 0),
  Communicable = c("C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C",
                   "NC", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C", "C")
)

# Save to CSV
write.csv(df, "diseases_with_communicable_status.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Print confirmation and disease classification
cat("CSV file created successfully!\n\n")
cat("Disease Classification:\n")
print(df[, c("Disease", "Communicable")], row.names = FALSE)
```

## 6.Ranking Top 5 Diseases by Death Count from L2_10city.csv

-   Loads L2_10city.csv data file.
-   Groups data by disease and sums death counts.
-   Ranks diseases and selects the top 5 with the highest death counts.
-   Saves the result to top_5_diseases.csv.

``` r
# Load dplyr package (install if needed: install.packages("dplyr"))
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("L2_10city.csv")

# Group by disease and sum death counts
disease_counts <- data %>%
  group_by(disease) %>%
  summarise(number = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Get top 5 diseases by death count
top_5_diseases <- disease_counts %>%
  arrange(desc(number)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)

# Save to CSV
write.csv(top_5_diseases, "top_5_diseases.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
